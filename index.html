        <p>My name is Max Handler and I'm majoring in Computer Science at Rutgers. 
        My goal is to grow as a software engineer and as a person. At Rutgers I'm involved with product
        engineer at Blueprint, Hack RU Finance, and the I.D.E.A program. When I'm not learning, I'm
        either playing soccer, working out, or exploring nature. If you wanna chat about CS or just
        general feel free to contanct me!</p>
